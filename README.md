# generate-changelog
generates changelog with jira-tickets from git and sets version in jira tickets

## Goals
Many developers working with Jira all workday. This tools creates a changelog for a release listing all Jira tickets since last release (in this case the last tag) and sets the fix version in Jira so one can see later in which release it was included. This way everyone gets the best of two worlds - having a [changelog][1] and see version info on Jira tickets.

## Alternatives
If you just look for a changelog generator for github, jump to [this](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator).
There is also a [js based changelog generator](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog).
None of them is dealing with jira.

You can then run the generator using
